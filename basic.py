# Basic syntax of Python

# Example to print text

# print("Hi, Pycharm")


# Example of Storing Variables

# Variables are connected to a value

# message = "Hello welcome to Python World"
# print(message)

# Going to combine messages.

# message = "I hope you are doing well"
# print(message)

# We received the value of the two messages on two separate lines

# A string is a series of characters.
# Example 'This is a string' also "This is a string"
# The example below using title () changes each word to a capital word.

# name = "mario.fletcher"
# print(name.title())

# Another example to change the word to an uppercase and lowercase

# name = "mario.fletcher"
# print(name.upper())
# print(name.lower())


# Using Variables in Strings
# f is used to format

# first_name = "mario"
# last_name = "fletcher"
# full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
# print(full_name)

# Using numbers in Python

# Floats
# print(3.5)

# Integer
# print(3)

# Example using a variable plus a function.

# calculation_to_units = 24
# name_of_units = "hours"
# print(f"20 days are {20 * calculation_to_units} {name_of_units}")
# print(f"35 days are {20 * calculation_to_units} {name_of_units}")
# print(f"50 days are {20 * calculation_to_units} {name_of_units}")
# print(f"110 days are {20 * calculation_to_units} {name_of_units}")
